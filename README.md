# RNAseq-undergrad-thesis
RNA seq project. Use Soft K-means to cluster RNA seq data of four yeast species based on orthology and expression pattern.

Data is the RNA-seq data of S. cerevisiae, C. glabrata, K. lactis and C. albicans. Orthogroup information is obtained from yeast gene order browser and Candida gene order browser.

Run the soft k-means with data that does not contain gene information.
